      side of the NBBO. Pegged Orders may have a limit price.
  -- Limit Orders (both Resident and IOC TimeInForce)
  -- Market Orders (both Resident and IOC TimeInForce)

Source Categories are defined as follows:

  -- Source Category 1:
      Retail orders routed by broker - dealer clients of the
       --- Retail Market Making business.
  -- Source Category 2: Certain orders received from --- algorithms,
       where the underlying client is an institutional client of ---.
  -- Source Category 3: Orders received from Order Originators that
       are determined by --- to exhibit lowto - neutral reversion.
  -- Source Category 4: All other orders not originating from Source
       Categories 1, 2 or 3.

(* Section 3.3 Crossing Restrictions

The --- ATS allows all Order Originators to use the following optional
crossing restrictions, on a per - order or configured basis:

 - No Self Cross: To prevent crossing against 'own orders'
    (orders sent with the same client ID).
 - No --- Principal: To prevent crossing against --- BD Principal Orders,
    or --- affiliate Principal orders.
 - Round Lot Only: To prevent crossing in other than round lot orders.
 - No Locked: To prevent crossing on a pegged order when the NBBO is locked.
    (Bid = Offer)
 - PeggedMidPointMode: To prevent a Mid - point Pegged Order from being executed
    at its limit price if (i) in the case of a buy order, its limit price is less
    than the mid - point of the spread between the NBB and NBO and (ii) in the
    case of a sell order, its limit price is greater than the mid - point of the
    spread between the NBB and NBO. In the event this restriction is not
    elected, a Mid - Point Pegged Order with a specified limit price may be executed
    at the limit price even if the price is not equal to the mid - point of the
    spread between the NBB and the NBBO.
 - Enable Conditionals: To enable a Resident Order to interact with Conditional Indicators.
 - Minimum Quantity: Orders may be routed to the --- ATS with a minimum quantity
    value specified. --- ATS will only cross where at least this number of shares
    is available from a single eligible contra side order. *)

From Section 4.1 "Eligible Resident Orders and IOC Orders are given priority
based first on price and second on the time of their receipt by the ATS.
Eligibility is determined based on the crossing restrictions associated with
the orders on both sides of the potential cross.
Invites are sent to the Order Originators of Conditional Indications on a
priority based first on price, second on the quantity and third on the time of
receipt by ATS. For orders with the same price and time, priority is given
to Resident and IOC Orders over Conditional Indications.

All marketable limit orders (i.e., buy orders with limit prices at or above the
NBO or sell orders with limit prices at or below the NBB) will be treated as
though they are at equivalent prices for priority purposes. As such, they will
be handled based strictly on time priority, as if they were market orders. If a
marketable limit order becomes non - marketable before execution, it will be treated
as a limit order and will receive price / time priority, with time based upon the
original time of receipt of the order by the ATS." *)
